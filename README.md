# StoryStructureCode

This is a new Repo for the project. previous repo was uncompatible while running it through the terminal via Atom and would throw up a "Python Can't open file: [Errono 2] no such file or directory" error message. Thing is, there was afile path and a directory... Don't know why Atom/Python behaved in this manner when project was originally turned into a git repo, commits were made/saved and program was working as it should. These issues only appeard the day after the repo was made.

So, this NEW repo is missing a few commits with explanations of what those commits were.
